                    Virginia Gardner
                </h3>
                <p class="about-desc">
                    Virginia Gardiner was born and raised in rural Rhode Island. She maintains a 
                    studio in her home and is the mother of two grown sons - Christopher and Matthew.
                    As a child, Virginia had a special love of animals, which led her to express 
                    herself by sculpting them. In high school she won a national sculpture award. 
                    After graduation, she attended the University of Hartford - Hartford Art School, 
                    majoring in sculpting.<br><br>

                    Virginia then pursued a career as a commercial sculptor, working as the main sculptor 
                    for Hasbro Toys. She was a member of the original GI JOE creative team and was the 
                    sculptor for the GI Nurse and the Foreign Soldiers. She then went on to work under 
                    the Vice President of Hasbro's Premium Division and sculpted for such clients as 
                    Disney, Nestles, Pillsbury, Kellogg's and others.<br><br>

                    Virginia left the commercial art world to return to her first love - sculpting animals. 
                    She presented a line of bronzes and pewters to the dog fancy, beginning with the Great 
                    Dane in 1976. A turning point in Virginia's career came when she met Ana Goulet who 
                    became her business partner in 1980. This partnership allowed Virginia to focus on her 
                    art, adding the line of custom jewelry in 14kt and 18kt gold.<br><br>

                    Virginia's artwork is recognized for its anatomical accuracy, expression of character 
                    and aesthetic appeal. Her creations have earned her many jewelry awards. Her custom, 
                    one-of-a-kind creations, are sought by discriminating clientele throughout the world. 
                    Virginia's art works reside in prestigious private collections as far away as Thailand, 
                    Japan, Australia, Europe, South America, Africa, most of the provinces of Canada and 
                    all of the fifty states.
